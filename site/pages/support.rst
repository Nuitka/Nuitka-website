While Nuitka is Free Software, your software is not, and you want to get
help with the tool, somebody to do it for you, or a quick solution, or
even better IP protection with more advanced techniques. You are best
served here in the `Nuitka Commercial area. </doc/commercial.html>`_.

.. _github-issue-tracker:

**********************

Nuitka uses GitHub for public issue tracking (commercial users have a
private tracker available) and your can report the issue on the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues>`_ there.

issue tracker, can be used for first contact and questions. It is not an
interactive User Manual though. Please refer to that first. You are also
welcome to lurk and help others. https://discord.gg/nZ9hr9tUck

Alternatively you can use this Gitter chat room, that mirrors the
