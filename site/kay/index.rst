*Creator of Nuitka Python Compiler*

****************
 About Kay
****************

I'm Kay Hayen, the creator and lead developer of the Nuitka Python compiler.
My journey into Python compilation began with a simple question: why isn't
there a proper Python compiler? This curiosity led me to create what started
as a toy project and evolved into the production-ready tool that Nuitka is
today.

*"I don't mind making mistakes, but I then take action for them to not repeat
or at least become less likely or impactful."*

******************
 The Nuitka Story
******************

My path to creating Nuitka wasn't straightforward. Initially, I contributed to
existing Python acceleration projects like PyPy, but I found them too
incompatible for use in large corporate codebases. This limitation drove me to
start fresh.

*"I was wondering why there is no Python compiler, so I started contributing
to projects that could be good for accelerating Python, e.g. PyPy, but I found
them to be too incompatible for usability on large corporate code bases. So I
made a toy compiler that turned into a proof of concept, that turned into the
real thing, that turned into my day job."*

Development Timeline
====================

**2008**: First commit - Nuitka was my first Git repository
   Initial commit (February 3, 2008): *"Attempt to get exception handlers into
   tree correctly"*

**2009-2010**: Core development phase
   Working intensively on the compiler foundation

**2011**: Public debut
   First presented Nuitka at PyCon DE as a working implementation

**2022**: All in with Nuitka
   At age 50, made Nuitka my full-time day job after 20 years in Air Traffic
   Control software development

   *"I am bad at marketing, but good at software, which is one more reason to
   purchase it. You know you love these kinds of people. Was that good
   marketing?"*

**Present**: Full-time focus
   Nuitka development is my day job, serving users worldwide

*****************
 Current Focus
*****************

Today, I continue to develop and maintain Nuitka, ensuring it remains the most
compatible and efficient Python compiler available. I'm also exploring new
horizons - recently started learning Spanish, adding to my repertoire of
skills.

The project has grown from a personal exploration into a vital tool used by
developers and organizations worldwide to create standalone Python executables.
