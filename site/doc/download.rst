Nuitka Standard
===============

The standard edition bundles your code, dependencies and data into a
single executable if you want. It also does acceleration, just running
faster in the same environment, and can produce extension modules as
well. It is freely distributed under the Apache license.

`Get Nuitka Standard </doc/download.html>`_

Nuitka Commercial
=================

The commercial edition additionally protects your code, data and
outputs, so that users of the executable cannot access these. This a
private repository of plugins that you pay to get access to.
Additionally, you can purchase priority support.

`Learn more about Nuitka commercial </doc/commercial.html>`_

The current release is Nuitka |NUITKA_VERSION|. Stable releases are
supported with hot fixes, indicated by the last of the 4 digits.

.. note::

   Stable releases are supposed to work for you. Develop releases are
   snapshots of the current ``develop`` branch in git, usually also
   relatively stable, but also rarely break.

.. note::

   During releases package builds can lag behind for a couple of days.

 PyPI
******

There is `Nuitka on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nuitka/>`__ as
well. So you can install with ``pip`` as follows.

.. note::

   The stable version from PyPI can be installed via pip, and has no
   dependencies on any package, and is a source package, so you will
   have an easy time, even on e.g. Windows to use it.

.. code:: bash

   # Stable version
   python -m pip install -U nuitka

   # Develop version
   python -m pip install -U "https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/archive/develop.zip"

.. note::

   Do this with the python binary, you want to be compiled against.

*********
 Sources
*********

.. include:: source-downloads.inc

.. note::

   The source archives can be used directly after unpacking, simply
   start with ``python bin/nuitka --help`` and read ``README.pdf`` or
   ``README.rst`` to get started. Take especially care to read the User
   Manual, such that you don't go on a wrong track.

**********
 Packages
**********

Windows
=======

The MSI installers are discontinued as Python has deprecated their
support for them, as well as Windows 10 making it harder to users to
install them. Using the PyPI installation is recommended on Windows.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
==================

-  |DEBIAN_LOGO| |UBUNTU_LOGO| |MINT_LOGO| Stable: Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
   repositories

   .. code:: bash

      CODENAME=`egrep 'UBUNTU_CODENAME|VERSION_CODENAME' /etc/os-release | sort | head -1 | cut -d= -f2`
      if [ -z "$CODENAME" ]
      then
         CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
      fi
      wget -O - https://nuitka.net/deb/archive.key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
      sudo echo >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nuitka.list "deb https://nuitka.net/deb/stable/$CODENAME $CODENAME main"
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install nuitka

-  |DEBIAN_LOGO| |UBUNTU_LOGO| |MINT_LOGO| Develop: Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
   repositories

   .. code:: bash

      CODENAME=`egrep 'UBUNTU_CODENAME|VERSION_CODENAME' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2`
      if [ -z "$CODENAME" ]
      then
         CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
      fi
      wget -O - https://nuitka.net/deb/archive.key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo apt-get install ca-certificates

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install nuitka

   .. note::

      Because Nuitka is part of Debian Stable/Testing/Unstable, a stable
      version is already in the standard repository. This is the only
      way to access the develop version of Nuitka though.
