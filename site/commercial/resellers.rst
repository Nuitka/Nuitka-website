   -  A: You can place an order anytime via the links above. The price
      will remain throughout your offer process. Should a price change
      between the time you made an offer to the end customer and them
      accepting it and your attempt to execute it, we will give you the
      old price.

      offer for renewal.

      We will also inform them, and cancel their access if this process
