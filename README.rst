Usage
=====

This is used to build the Nuitka web site. Enhancements of all kinds are
welcome. You will need python 3.7 and pipenv to build it, and so far this
has only be done on Linux, but it ought to also work on Windows:

.. code-block:: sh

    # On Ubuntu only
    sudo apt-get install optipng jpegoptim

    # Creates a virtualenv with all that is needed to develop the
    # site.
    python3.7 -m pip install pipenv
    python3.7 -m pipenv install --dev

    # Need to do this at least once.
    python3.7 -m pipenv run ./update.py --update-docs
    # Now lets build the site
    python3.7 -m pipenv run ./update.py --build-site

    # Start local web server with the site.
    python3.7 -m pipenv run nikola auto

    # Browse it (Linux)
    xdg-open http://localhost:8080
    # Browse it (Windows)
    explorer http://localhost:8080


Usage of Nikola
===============

So the site is basically mostly an automation of importing a few files from
the git repository, splitting up e.g. the ``Changelog.rst`` into pages, with
otherwise using Nikola to render it. Reference the `Nikola handbook
<https://getnikola.com/handbook.html>`__ if you have any questions about how
it does that, but it's easy enough.

Thanks
======

Please help and improve this in all ways, typos, cooler tech, better looks,
more information, etc. all is appreciated and necessary.

Right now, this is very rough and the first public release after running this
in private for the longest time. The code is a hack and ugly, and the content
could be way more readable. Your turn!
