"Your program might be using Qt and QML, or data files loaded. With Nuitka"
" Commercial, you can product (even before onefile) an executable that "
"contains them and then also covers it under the regular `constants data "
"protection <protect-constants-data.html>`__ automatically."

"Your program uses standard Python mechanisms from ``pkgutil``, "
"``pkg_resources``, ``importlib.resources`` or ``importlib_resources`` and"
" generally similar packages, and these load the data as a file or a "
"stream from within the binary without ever hitting the disk."

"All of this is happening with the same code base, i.e. you are not making"
" any modification (if at all), that is incompatible with Python. Your "
"code will still run directly. One thing you do have to change though is "
"to not use ``open`` with paths created from ``__file__``, but the above "
"code is more elegant anyway, as it does this for you in the normal case, "
"but can easily be hooked by Nuitka."

"Due to constant data protection, the contents of the files will be "
"inaccessible to anything but the program, and this is very much what "
"people want."

"In standard Nuitka, you end up with something like this. And note, that "
"onefile mode is merely a self extracting archive, i.e. these files will "
"be on the customer disk for inspection:"

"For extension modules and DLLs used, this doesn't affect things. This is "
"about merely about data files. This is where onefile comes in and hides "
"these from the view and need for deployment, but it cannot replace Nuitka"
" commercial and its inclusion of data files inside the main binary."
