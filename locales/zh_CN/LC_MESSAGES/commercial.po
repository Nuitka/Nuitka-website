"Hiding your source code and contained keys is crucial to your IP "

"Normally these constants are plain and readable in the created programs "
"(and of course your Python source code or bytecode). Compiling with "
"Nuitka gives you protection of the code, but with the data being easily "
"readable, it will be less effective."

"Another facet of the data protection is data files. When your program "
"includes data files to work on, these are visible in the file system. "
"Sometimes, e.g. via QML files of Qt, your program behavior can be changed"
" by an attacker modifying these files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/doc/commercial.rst:48

"Therefore Nuitka commercial allows you to include data files as part of "
"the program constants and protect it in the same way as other constants. "

"When your program is deployed and crashing, you could take potentially "

"Python tracebacks are good for this, but you cannot want them to be "
