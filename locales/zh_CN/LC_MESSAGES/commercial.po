msgid "Protection vs. Reverse Enginneering"

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:12
msgid ""
"Hiding your source code and contained keys is crucial to your IP "
"protection. For this, you need the Nuitka commercial package. It contains"
" plugins to Nuitka that will achieve the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:21
msgid "Obfuscucate contained program constants data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:23
msgid ""
"Your encryption keys, your program texts, your library usages, all expose"
" textual information, that can be valuable input in Reverse Enginneering."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:27
msgid ""
"Normally these constants are plain and readable in the created programs "
"(and of course your Python source code or bytecode). Compiling with "
"Nuitka gives you protection of the code, but with the data being easily "
"readable, it will be less effective."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:32
msgid "`Read more.... <commercial/protect-constants-data.html>`__"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:37
msgid ""
"Another facet of the same issue is datafiles. When your program includes "
"data files to work on, these are visible in the file system. Sometimes, "
"e.g. via QML files of Qt, your program behaviour can be changed by "
"changing these files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:42
msgid ""
"Therefore Nuitka commercial allows you to include data files as part of "
"the program constants and protect it in the same way as other constants. "
"Without these files accessible, the attacker will have no attack vector "
"for Reverse Enginneering."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:50
msgid ""
"When your program is deployed and crashing, you could take potentially "
"successful steps against these tracebacks appearing. But when you need to"
" support your client, you need to be able to to actually tell, why your "
"software is crashing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:55
msgid ""
"Python tracebacks are good for this, but you cannot want them to be "
"readable to the user. This is very traceback encryption comes in. Nuitka "
"with the commercial plugin will make sure to encrypt all traceback "
"outputs. They still carry the information as you want, but *only you* "
"will be able to decode them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:61
msgid ""
"Symmetric encryption (and asymmetric encryption in a future update) are "
"available for you to use there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:64
msgid ""
"In a future update, you can decide which information is transferred, and "
"what is part of the encryption, and which part is not, e.g. hostname, "
"client name, etc. could be output int plain text, while the variable "
"names and values would not be, depending on your choice!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:72
msgid ""
"If you need to query information from a machine, or just in general want "
"to have perfect protection, you can use the Nuitka plugin to make sure it"
" can only output encrypted information on standard output and standard "
"error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/commercial.rst:77
msgid ""
"This will allow you to decode outputs as necessary, and will make sure "
"it's not readable to anybody but you."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for these things will also be covered in the Nuitka commercial "
