"Today, Sunday 30.01.2022, there will be the third live stream of me "
"coding on Nuitka, and talking and chatting with visitors in the Discord "
"channel created specifically for this. I will go from 9-12 CEST and from "
"18 CEST until probably at least 20 CEST, but it seems I tend to go "
"overtime."

"In the second stream I was working on Onefile compression for all Python "
"versions, by making the location of another Python that for Scons we sort"
" of did already, reusable. So now, you can run Nuitka with Python2.6 and "
"compile your legacy code, while with say 3.6 also installed on the same "
"system, you do the ``zstandard`` compression. That will be used for other"
" things in the future as well. This is going to be part of the next "
"release and currently on develop."

"In the first stream, I also did a little bit of performance plans, but "
"mostly only showing people what I have there in stock, not actually went "
"there and I started work on a ``upx`` plugin, such that DLLs for "
"standalone are compressed with that. That also required a bit of plugin "
"interface changes and research. This one works mostly, but will need more"
" live. Also I think I looked at reducing what is included with the follow"
" standard library option, getting very minimal distributions out of it."

"Not sure yet, what to do. I might be debugging issues I have with 2.6 and"
" a recent optimization, that prevents factory branch from becoming the "
"next pre-release, I might be looking at macOS still. And I might be "
"looking at the caching of bytecode demoted modules, that is kind of ready"
" to be used, but is not currently, which is a pity. And of course, the "
"Python PGO may get a closer look, such that e.g. it works for standalone "
"mode."
