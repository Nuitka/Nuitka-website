"While the ``pyside2`` plugin of Nuitka can workaround some issues PySide "
"5.15.2.1 has to support compiled methods as callbacks, these are far from"
" complete. Some programs work, but many do have problems, esp. in "
"reacting to events."

"For this the PySide2 wheels provided by Nuitka commercial contain a "
"backport of the PySide6 changes made to support compiled code perfectly. "
"The support of PySide6 is much better, but unfortunately not perfect. "
"However, all current known bugs with PySide6 do not affect PySide2 as "
"accessible in Nuitka commercial."

"For older PySide2 and just generally, the recommended solution is to use "
"the wheels as provided by Nuitka commercial. There is no way these "
"patches will be backported and as a result, we have that backported patch"
" that will not get released in any other way. This is very "
"understandable, now that Qt6 is out."
