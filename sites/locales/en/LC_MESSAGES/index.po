msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:9
msgid "Nuitka is a Python compiler written in Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:11
msgid "It is fully compatible with Python2 (2.6, 2.7) and Python3 (3.3 - 3.10)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:13
msgid ""
"You feed Nuitka your Python app, it does a lot of clever things, and then"
" creates an executable or extension module, or even a Python wheel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nuitka is distributed under the Apache license. Nuitka commercial is a "
"private repository that you pay to access and get plugins for commercial "
"usage."

"Right now Nuitka is a good replacement for the Python interpreter. It "
"compiles **every** language construct in all relevant CPython versions, "
"and even the irrelevant ones like 2.6 and 3.3. It translates Python into "
"a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute exactly like"
" CPython. It is extremely compatible."

"Nuitka is already slightly faster than CPython, but there is work to be "
"done to include as many C optimizations as possible. We currently get a "
"335% speedup in pystone, which is a good start. (source: Nuitka version "
"0.6.17 with Debian Python 2.7)"

msgid "Future"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:40
msgid ""
"In the future Nuitka will be able to use type inferencing based on whole "
"program analysis. It will apply that information in order to perform as "
"many calculations as possible in C, using C native types, without "
"accessing ``libpython``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:45
msgid ""
"Nuitka will also be able to integrate ``ctypes`` bindings, but without "
"the usual speed penalty. The compiled program can call the C library "
"directly, avoiding run-time overhead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:49
msgid ""
"And finally, you will be able to use a ``hints`` module to inform Nuitka "
"about type information."

msgid "Now vs. Future, or, The Plan"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:55
msgid "These are the milestones and priorities for Nuitka's development."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:57
msgid ""
"Total feature parity with Python. Understand all language constructs, and"
" behave exactly like CPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:60
msgid ""
"Create the most efficient native C code possible. The goal is to make "
"basic Python object handling as fast as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:63
msgid ""
"Implement constant propagation. Determine as many values and useful "
"constraints as possible at compile time, and create extremely efficient "
"code for the compiler."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:67
msgid ""
"Make intelligent type inferences. Detect and use special case handling "
"for strings, integers, and lists in the compiled program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:70
msgid ""
"Add interfacing with C code to allow Nuitka to turn Python ``ctypes`` "
"bindings into efficient C bindings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:73
msgid ""
"Provide a hints module with a useful Python implementation so the "
"compiler can learn about intended types directly from the programmer."

msgid "Where are we now?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:79
msgid ""
"Milestone 1, feature parity, has been achieved for Python 2.6, 2.7, and "
"3.3 up to 3.10. This part of Nuitka is already mature, but every new "
"Python release has lots of new features to add!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:83
msgid ""
"Milestone 2 is always a work in progress, but it has been quite "
"successful. Nuitka can already produce code that is more than 2 times "
"faster than CPython. These gains are nowhere near the best gains "
"possible, but they are solid improvements and will improve further."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:88
msgid ""
"Milestone 3, constant folding and propagation, is already in place, and "
"some control flow optimizations are also applied - but this is just the "
"start. Constant folding will see big gains as the type inferencing "
"matures and more variables are opened up to become constants."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:93
msgid ""
"For milestone 4 the first steps are in place achieve type inferencing. "
"The results are encouraging, but it will need a lot more work before this"
" can be made the default approach. Remember that this is still Python, "
"Nuitka cannot be guaranteed to perfectly guess type information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/index.txt:98
msgid ""
"We have yet to start on milestones 5 and 6. There is still quite a way to"
" go until we hit the \"future\"."
