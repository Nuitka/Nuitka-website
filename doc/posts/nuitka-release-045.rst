 Nuitka Release 0.4.5
######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release incorporates very many bug fixes, most of which were
already part of hot fixes, usability improvements, documentation
improvements, new logo, simpler Python3 on Windows, warnings for
recursion options, and so on. So it's mostly a consolidation release.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  When targeting Python 3.x, Nuitka was using "python" to run Scons to
   run it under Python 2.x, which is not good enough on systems, where
   that is already Python3. Improved to only do the guessing where
   necessary (i.e. when using the in-line copy of Scons) and then to
   prefer "python2". Fixed in 0.4.4.1 already.

-  When using Nuitka created binaries inside a "virtualenv", created
   programs would instantly crash. The attempt to load and patch
   ``inspect`` module was not making sure that ``site`` module was
   already imported, but inside the "virtualenv", it cannot be found
   unless. Fixed in 0.4.4.1 already.

-  The option ``--recurse-directory`` to include plugin directories was
   broken. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  Python3: Files with "BOM" marker causes the compiler to crash. Fixed
   in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  Windows: The generated code for ``try``/``return``/``finally`` was
   working with gcc (and therefore MinGW), but not with MSVC, causing
   crashes. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  The option ``--recurse-all`` did not recurse to package
   ``__init__.py`` files in case ``from x.y import z`` syntax was used.
   Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  Python3 on macOS: Corrected link time error. Fixed in 0.4.4.2
   already.

-  Python3.3 on Windows: Fixed crash with too many arguments to a kwonly
   argument using function. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  Python3.3 on Windows: Using "yield from" resulted in a link time
   error. Fixed in 0.4.4.2 already.

-  Windows: Added back XML manifest, found a case where it is needed to
   prevent clashes with binary modules.

-  Windows: Generators only worked in the main Python threads. Some
   unusual threading modules therefore failed.

-  Using ``sys.prefix`` to find the Python installation instead of hard
   coded paths.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Windows: Python3 finds Python2 installation to run Scons
   automatically now.

   Nuitka itself runs under Python3 just fine, but in order to build the
   generated C++ code into binaries, it uses Scons which still needs
   Python2.

   Nuitka will now find the Python2 installation searching Windows
   registry instead of requiring hard coded paths.

-  Windows: Python2 and Python3 find their headers now even if Python is
   not installed to specific paths.

   The installation path now is passed on to Scons which then uses it.

-  Better error checking for ``--recurse-to`` and ``--recurse-not-to``
   arguments, tell the user not to use directory paths.

-  Added a warning for ``--recurse-to`` arguments that end up having no
   effect to the final result.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Import mechanism got cleaned up, stopped using
   "PyImport_ExtendInittab". It does not handle packages, and the
   ``sys.meta_path`` based importer is now well proven.

-  Moved some of the constraint collection code mess into proper places.
   It still remains a mess.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  Added ``LICENSE.txt`` file with Apache License 2.0 text to make it
   more immediately obvious which license Nuitka is under.

-  Added section about Nuitka license to the `User Manual
   <https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html#license>`__.

-  Added `Nuitka Logo
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/blob/develop/doc/Logo/Nuitka-Logo-Symbol.svg>`__
   to the distribution.

-  Use Nuitka Logo as the bitmap in the Windows installer.

-  Use Nuitka Logo in the documentation (`User Manual
   <https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__ and `Developer Manual
   <https://nuitka.net/doc/developer-manual.html>`__).

-  Enhanced documentation to number page numbers starting after table of
   contents, removed header/footer from cover pages.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release is mostly the result of improvements made based on the
surge of users after Europython 2013. Some people went to extents and
reported their experience very detailed, and so I could aim at making
e.g. their misconceptions about how recursion options work, more obvious
through warnings and errors.

This release is not addressing performance improvements. The next
release will be able to focus on that. I am taking my claim of full
compatibility very serious, so any time it's broken, it's the highest
priority to restore it.
