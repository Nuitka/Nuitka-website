****************
 What is Nuitka
****************

Nuitka is the optimizing Python compiler written in Python that creates
executables that run without an need for a separate installer. Data
files can both be included or put alongside.

It is fully compatible with Python2 (2.6, 2.7) and Python3 (3.3 - 3.10),
works on Windows, macOS, Linux and more, basically where Python works
for you already.

It protects your code and data, esp. with the Nuitka commercial
offering, and also just works and is easy to use.

Nuitka is freely distributed under the Apache license. Nuitka commercial
is a private repository that you pay to access and get plugins for
commercial usage.

In the meantime you can checkout why `Nuitka commercial
</doc/commercial.html>`__ is for you or find the its `standard version
