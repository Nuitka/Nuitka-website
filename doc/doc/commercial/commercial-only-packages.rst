 Commercial-only Packages
##########################

There currently are two packages that are with commercial only support.
They are exceptions though, generally the support is in proper Nuitka.
Due to the relatively low price, no trials are available, but these are
known to work excellent.

*********
 PySide2
*********

These are `PySide2 </pages/pyside2.html>`_ for which back-ports of
patches created by Nuitka have been integrated. This work needs to be
compensated for and therefore requires the subscription. Others can use
PySide6 which contains these patches and is freely available.

***************
 Web3/eth-hash
***************

This requires a plugin ``ethereum`` that handles the backend selection.
We have chosen to only offer as part of the commercial subscription,
since this was paid for by a commercial customer and is absolutely a
sign of a commercial application. When you process crypto payments or
money, you can definitely ought to subscribe to Nuitka commercial
anyway, as things are otherwise not secure enough.
