 Protect Program Constants Data
################################

Your program might be using Qt and QML, or data files loaded. With
Nuitka Commercial, you can product (even before onefile) an executable
that contains them and then also covers it under the regular `constants
data protection <protect-constants-data.html>`__ automatically.

Your program uses standard Python mechanisms from ``pkgutil``,
``pkg_resources``, ``importlib.resources`` or ``importlib_resources``
and generally similar packages, and these load the data as a file or a
stream from within the binary without ever hitting the disk.

All of this is happening with the same code base, i.e. you are not
making any modification (if at all), that is incompatible with Python.
Your code will still run directly. One thing you do have to change
though is to not use ``open`` with paths created from ``__file__``, but
the above code is more elegant anyway, as it does this for you in the
normal case, but can easily be hooked by Nuitka.

This means, e.g. rather than this program

.. code::

   PySideQmlPolarchartTest.py
   qmlpolarchart/
       Example-Icon.png
       Example-Icon.svg
       main.qml
       View1.qml
       View2.qml
       View3.qml

you get a file layout just simply like this

.. code::

   PySideQmlPolarchartTest.exe

Due to constant data protection, the contents of the files will be
inaccessible to anything but the program, and this is very much what
people want.

In standard Nuitka, you end up with something like this. And note, that
onefile mode is merely a self extracting archive, i.e. these files will
be on the customer disk for inspection:

.. code::

   PySideQmlPolarchartTest.exe
   qmlpolarchart/
       Example-Icon.png
       Example-Icon.svg
       main.qml
       View1.qml
       View2.qml
       View3.qml

.. note::

   For extension modules and DLLs used, this doesn't affect things. This
   is about merely about data files. This is where onefile comes in and
   hides these from the view and need for deployment, but it cannot
   replace Nuitka commercial and its inclusion of data files inside the
   main binary.
