Hello there,

as I previously said, I will make these a separate announcement. Thanks to the NeuroDebian
project build infrastructure, there is Nuitka packages for the Ubuntu versions back to
Maverick, Natty, and Oneiric.

Please see the page `What is Nuitka? </pages/overview.html>`_ for clarification of
what it is now and what it wants to be.

You may use the apt sources to track Nuitka or download the packages from the page where I offer the `latest version here </pages/download.html>`_.

Note: In fact, it's 0.3.19.1 now, which includes a hotfix release made after 0.3.19. The same is in Debian Unstable right now, waiting to propagate into Debian Testing, where there is still 0.3.18 living at this time.

I would appreciate feedback on these.

Thanks in advance,
Kay
