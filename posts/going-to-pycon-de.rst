Hello everybody,

I am going to the German Python conference in Leipzip and I am going to have a
`presentation <http://2011.de.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/54/>`_ (link in
German) there.

Of course it's about Nuitka (see `What is Nuitka? </pages/overview.html>`_ ) and
I hope it will get a lot of attendance. I am naturally very happy to have the
opportunity to present it finally. I had wanted to visit PyCon EU, but the date
was never known, and then my early booking holiday overlapped with it, so it was
not an option.

Now giving this presentation will of course be exciting to me. I gave
presentations as part of the day job many times, but this time it's obviously a
different. It's also a first chance to meet the others as I never was at a
Python conference before, and that will be interesting in itself.

Presenting Nuitka will of course be easy for me. Now I need to plan what I want
to be able to present for a demo. Running a big thing like Mercurial would be
nice, but I honestly don't know, if that will even be difficult, or if it will
take a lot of work. Also the amount of documentation available for Nuitka should
increase as part of this. Designs, etc. could be made into diagrams, so people
who want to join will have it easier.

Lots of possibilities, and then there is only going to be one reality. Lets hope
it's good. :-)

Yours,
Kay
