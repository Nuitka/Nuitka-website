The good news are lately coming in high density, although I barely have
the opportunity to work on Nuitka. Check the page `What is Nuitka?
</pages/overview.html>`_ for clarification of what it is now and what it
wants to be.

It seems my `recent call for help
<nuitka-needs-you-a-call-for-help.html>`_ was at least partially
effective. One the major points has been addressed. In the next release,
Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 will both work for Nuitka, right now it's
only in git develop branch.

That is really nice, as it will make Nuitka on Windows a whole lot more
accessible. Combine that with `portable support
<support-for-portable-standalone-programs.html>`_ and it's up to solving
problems with distributing on Windows it seems.

The other two things listed there have received no feedback yet. So if
you want to help with those, feel free to do so. Nuitka needs you.
