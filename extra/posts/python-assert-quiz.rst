####################
 Python Assert Quiz
####################

At Europython conference, in my presentation, I talked about
re-formulations of Python into simpler Python. It is my intention to
turn this into a series of Python quiz questions that you will hopefully
enjoy.

.. admonition:: Update

   Due to comments feedback, I made it more clear that "-O" affects of
   course both cases, and due to work on getting the recent CPython2.7
   test suite to work, I noticed, how the re-formulation for Quiz
   Question 2 needed a version dependent solution.

   And I thought this one was easy. :-)

*****************
 Quiz Question 1
*****************

Say you have the following code:

.. code:: python

   assert x == y

How can you achieve the same thing, without using the ``assert``
statement at all. The behavior is required to be absolutely the same.

The answer is in the next paragraph, so stop reading if you want to find
out yourself.

************
 Solution 1
************

The correct answer is that assertions are the same as a raise exception
in a conditional statement.

.. code:: python

   if not x == y:
       raise AssertionError

The thing where this makes a difference, is "-O", which will discard
assertions, but I consider it rarely used. To be really compatible with
that, it should be:

.. code:: python

   if __debug__ and not x == y:
       raise AssertionError

*****************
 Quiz Question 2
*****************

But wait, there is slightly more to it. Say you have the following code:

.. code:: python

   assert x == y, arg

How can you achieve the same thing, without using the ``assert``
statement at all. The behavior is required to be absolutely the same.

The answer is in the next paragraph, so stop reading if you want to find
out yourself.

************
 Solution 2
************

This is actually version dependent, due to recent optimizations of
CPython.

-  For version 2.6 it is as follows:

   The extra value to ``assert``, simply becomes an extra value to
   raise, which indicates, delayed creation of the ``AssertionError``
   exception.

   .. code:: python

      if not x == y:
          raise AssertionError, arg

-  For version 2.7 and higher it is as follows:

   The extra value to ``assert``, simply becomes the argument to
   creating the ``AssertionError`` exception.

   .. code:: python

      if not x == y:
          raise AssertionError(arg)

So, even in the more complex case, you end up with a conditional
``raise``.

The only thing where this makes a difference, is "-O", which will
discard assertions, but I consider it rarely used. To be really
compatible with that, it should be:

   .. code:: python

      if __debug__ and not x == y:
         raise AssertionError ....

Surprised? Well, yes, there really is nothing to ``assert`` statements.
I am using this for my `Python compiler Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`_
which benefits from having not to deal with ``assert`` as anything
special at all. See also the `respective section in the Developer Manual
</doc/developer-manual.html#the-assert-statement>`_ which explains this
and other things.
