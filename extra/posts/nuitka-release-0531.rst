#######################
 Nuitka Release 0.5.31
#######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release is massive in terms of fixes, but also adds a lot of
refinement to code generation, and more importantly adds experimental
support for Python 3.7, while enhancing support for Pyt5 in standalone
mode by a lot.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Standalone: Added missing dependencies for ``PyQt5.Qt`` module.

-  Plugins: Added support for ``PyQt5.Qt`` module and its ``qml``
   plugins.

-  Plugins: The sensible plugin list for PyQt now includes that
   platforms plugins on Windows too, as they are kind of mandatory.

-  Python3: Fix, for uninstalled Python versions wheels that linked
   against the ``Python3`` library as opposed to ``Python3X``, it was
   not found.

-  Standalone: Prefer DLLs used by main program binary over ones used by
   wheels.

-  Standalone: For DLLs added by Nuitka plugins, add the package
   directory to the search path for dependencies where they might live.

-  Fix, the ``vars`` built-in didn't annotate its exception exit.

-  Python3: Fix, the ``bytes`` and ``complex`` built-ins needs to be
   treated as a slot too.

-  Fix, consider if ``del`` variable must be assigned, in which case no
   exception exit should be created. This prevented ``Tkinter``
   compilation.

-  Python3.6: Added support for the following language construct:

   .. code:: python

      d = {"metaclass": M}


      class C(**d):
          pass

-  Python3.5: Added support for cyclic imports. Now a ``from`` import
   with a name can really cause an import to happen, not just a module
   attribute lookup.

-  Fix, ``hasattr`` was never raising exceptions.

-  Fix, ``bytearray`` constant values were considered to be
   non-iterable.

-  Python3.6: Fix, now it is possible to ``del __annotations__`` in a
   class and behave compatible. Previously in this case we were falling
   back to the module variable for annotations used after that which is
   wrong.

-  Fix, some built-in type conversions are allowed to return derived
   types, but Nuitka assumed the exact type, this affected ``bytes``,
   ``int``, ``long``, ``unicode``.

-  Standalone: Fix, the ``_socket`` module was insisted on to be found,
   but can be compiled in.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Added experimental support for Python 3.7, more work will be needed
   though for full support. Basic tests are working, but there are are
   at least more coroutine changes to follow.

-  Added support for building extension modules against statically
   linked Python. This aims at supporting manylinux containers, which
   are supposed to be used for creating widely usable binary wheels for
   Linux. Programs won't work with statically linked Python though.

-  Added options to allow ignoring the Windows cache for DLL
   dependencies or force an update.

-  Allow passing options from distutils to Nuitka compilation via setup
   options.

-  Added option to disable the DLL dependency cache on Windows as it may
   become wrong after installing new software.

-  Added experimental ability to provide extra options for Nuitka to
   setuptools.

-  Python3: Remove frame preservation and restoration of exceptions.
   This is not needed, but leaked over from Python2 code.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Apply value tracing to local dict variables too, enhancing the
   optimization for class bodies and function with ``exec`` statements
   by a lot.

-  Better optimization for "must not have value", wasn't considering
   merge traces of uninitialized values, for which this is also the
   case.

-  Use 10% less memory at compile time due to specialized base classes
   for statements with a single child only allowing ``__slots__`` usage
   by not having multiple inheritance for those.

-  More immediately optimize branches with known truth values, so that
   merges are avoided and do not prevent trace based optimization before
   the pass after the next one. In some cases, optimization based on
   traces could fail to be done if there was no next pass caused by
   other things.

-  Much faster handling for functions with a lot of ``eval`` and
   ``exec`` calls.

-  Static optimization of ``type`` with known type shapes, the value is
   predicted at compile time.

-  Optimize containers for all compile time constants into constant
   nodes. This also enables further compile time checks using them, e.g.
   with ``isinstance`` or ``in`` checks.

-  Standalone: Using threads when determining DLL dependencies. This
   will speed up the un-cached case on Windows by a fair bit.

-  Also remove unused assignments for mutable constant values.

-  Python3: Also optimize calls to ``bytes`` built-in, this was so far
   not done.

-  Statically optimize iteration over constant values that are not
   iterable into errors.

-  Removed Fortran, Java, LaTex, PDF, etc. stuff from the inline copies
   of Scons for faster startup and leaner code. Also updated to 3.0.1
   which is no important difference over 3.0.0 for Nuitka however.

-  Make sure to always release temporary objects before checking for
   error exits. When done the other way around, more C code than
   necessary will be created, releasing them in both normal case and
   error case after the check.

-  Also remove unused assignments in case the value is a mutable
   constant.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Don't store "version" numbers of variable traces for code generation,
   instead directly use the references to the value traces instead,
   avoiding later lookups.

-  Added dedicated module for ``complex`` built-in nodes.

-  Moved C helpers for integer and complex types to dedicated files,
   solving the TODOs around them.

-  Removed some Python 3.2 only codes.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  For better bug reports, the ``--version`` output now contains also
   the Python version information and the binary path being used.

-  Started using specialized exceptions for some types of errors, which
   will output the involved data for better debugging without having to
   reproduce anything. This does e.g. output XML dumps of problematic
   nodes.

-  When encountering a problem (compiler crash) in optimization, output
   the source code line that is causing the issue.

-  Added support for Fedora 28 RPM builds.

-  Remove more instances of mentions of 3.2 as supported or usable.

-  Renovated the graphing code and made it more useful.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release marks important progress, as the locals dictionary tracing
is a huge step ahead in terms of correctness and proper optimization.
The actual resulting dictionary is not yet optimized, but that ought to
follow soon now.

The initial support of 3.7 is important. Right now it apparently works
pretty well as a 3.6 replacement already, but definitely a lot more work
will be needed to fully catch up.

For standalone, this accumulated a lot of improvements related to the
plugin side of Nuitka. Thanks to those involved in making this better.
On Windows things ought to be much faster now, due to parallel usage of
dependency walker.
