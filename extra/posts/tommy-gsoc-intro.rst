 Tommy's Google Summer of Code Intro

Hi all! :)

My name is Taofeng Li and I go by the nickname of Tommy, github handle
`tommyli3318 <https://github.com/tommyli3318>`__. I'm a Computer Science
major at the University of California, Irvine in the United States. I am
very excited to announce that I'll be contributing to Nuitka this summer
under the Google Summer of Code program!

My project is "Nuitka support for PyPI top 50", it ensures Nuitka’s
compatibility with the 50 most popular PyPI packages by setting up
automated testing for each package. These automated tests will serve to
be very important tools for the development of Nuitka, as they will be
used to assure Nuitka’s compatibility with the most used Python packages
every time Nuitka receives a new update.

My mentors will be Vaibhav Tulsyan, Kamran Ghanaat, and Kay Hayen. My
project abstract can be seen `here
<https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4874692681269248>`__ and
the full details of my project can be found `here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdbXyMy5xjVEeWociI_t2f6tlmge6czT0xmfCLyDXYg/edit?usp=sharing>`__.

I am greatly looking forward to the many things that I'll learn this
summer!
