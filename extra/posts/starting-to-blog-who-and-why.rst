 Starting to blog, who and why?
################################

My name is Kay Hayen, I was born in 1972 in the very northern part of
Germany very close to the North Sea.

I am privately a developer of Free Software, and currently preparing the
release of my Python compiler. The name of the project will be "Nuitka"
chosen to honor my Russian wife Anna. We are a happy family with 2 sons,
born 2004 and 2007.

I am starting this blog mostly to report about the new compiler. I don't
think I will share much about my private life here, but I sure will
share a couple of photos with you occasionally. But mostly I will be
excited to report on the compiler progress.

So far I didn't feel like I had anything to say, but the compiler is
approaching its release later this month, and I will need a forum to
talk about it.
