######################
 Nuitka Release 0.4.2
######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release comes with many bug fixes, some of which are severe. It
also contains new features, like basic Python 3.3 support. And the
`performance diagrams <https://nuitka.net/pages/performance.html>`__ got
expanded.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Support for FreeBSD.

   Nuitka works for at least FreeBSD 9.1, older versions may or may not
   work. This required only fixing some "Linuxisms" in the build
   process.

-  New option for warning about compile time detected exception raises.

   Nuitka can now warn about exceptions that will be raised at run time.

-  Basic Python3.3 support.

   The test suite of CPython3.2 passes and fails in a compatible way.
   New feature ``yield from`` is not yet supported, and the improved
   argument parsing error messages are not implemented yet.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Nuitka already supported compilation of "main directories", i.e.
   directories with a "__main__.py" file inside. The resulting binary
   name was "__main__.exe" though, but now it is "directory.exe"

   .. code:: bash

      # ls directory
      __main__.py

      # nuitka --exe directory
      # ls
      directory directory.exe

   This makes this usage more obvious, and fixes an older issue for this
   feature.

-  Evaluation order of binary operators was not enforced.

   Nuitka already enforces evaluation order for just about everything.
   But not for binary operators it seems.

-  Providing an ``# coding: no-exist`` was crashing under Python2, and
   ignored under Python3, now it does the compatible thing for both.

-  Global statements on the compiler level are legal in Python, and were
   not handled by Nuitka, they now are.

   .. code:: python

      global a  # Not in a function, but on module level. Pointless but legal!
      a = 1

   Effectively these statements can be ignored.

-  Future imports are only legal when they are at the start of the file.

   This was not enforced by Nuitka, making it accept code, which CPython
   would reject. It now properly raises a syntax error.

-  Raising exceptions from context was leaking references.

   .. code:: python

      raise ValueError() from None

   Under CPython3.2 the above is not allowed (it is acceptable starting
   CPython3.3), and was also leaking references to its arguments.

-  Importing the module that became ``__main__`` through the module
   name, didn't recurse to it.

   This also gives a warning. PyBench does it, and then stumbles over
   the non-found "pybench" module. Of course, programmers should use
   ``sys.modules[ "__main__" ]`` to access main module code. Not only
   because the duplicated modules don't share data.

-  Compiled method ``repr`` leaked references when printed.

   When printing them, they would not be freed, and subsequently hold
   references to the object (and class) they belong to. This could
   trigger bugs for code that expects ``__del__`` to run at some point.

-  The ``super`` built-in leaked references to given object.

   This was added, because Python3 needs it. It supplies the arguments
   to ``super`` automatically, whereas for Python2 the programmer had to
   do it. And now it turns out that the object lost a reference, causing
   similar issues as above, preventing ``__del__`` to run.

-  The ``raise`` statement didn't enforce type of third argument.

   This Python2-only form of exception raising now checks the type of
   the third argument before using it. Plus, when it's None (which is
   also legal), no reference to None is leaked.

-  Python3 built-in exceptions were strings instead of exceptions.

   A gross mistake that went uncaught by test suites. I wonder how. Them
   being strings doesn't help their usage of course, fixed.

-  The ``-nan`` and ``nan`` both exist and make a difference.

   A older story continued. There is a sign to ``nan``, which can be
   copied away and should be present. This is now also supported by
   Nuitka.

-  Wrong optimization of ``a == a``, ``a != a``, ``a <= a`` on C++
   level.

   While it's not done during Nuitka optimization, the rich comparison
   helpers still contained short cuts for ``==``, ``!=``, and ``<=``.

-  The ``sys.executable`` for ``nuitka-python --python-version 3.2`` was
   still ``python``.

   When determining the value for ``sys.executable`` the CPython library
   code looks at the name ``exec`` had received. It was ``python`` in
   all cases, but now it depends on the running version, so it
   propagates.

-  Keyword only functions with default values were losing references to
   defaults.

   .. code:: python

      def f(*, a=X()):
          pass


      f()
      f()  # Can crash, X() should already be released.

   This is now corrected. Of course, a Python3 only issue.

-  Pressing CTRL-C didn't generate ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in compiled
   code.

   Nuitka never executes "pending calls". It now does, with the upside,
   that the solution used, appears to be suitable for threading in
   Nuitka too. Expect more to come out of this.

-  For ``with`` statements with ``return``, ``break``, or ``continue``
   to leave their body, the ``__exit__`` was not called.

   .. code:: python

      with a:  # This called a.__enter__().
          return 2  # This didn't call a.__exit__(None, None, None).

   This is of course quite huge, and unfortunately wasn't covered by any
   test suite so far. Turns out, the re-formulation of ``with``
   statements, was wrongly using ``try/except/else``, but these ignore
   the problematic statements. Only ``try/finally`` does. The enhanced
   re-formulation now does the correct thing.

-  Starting with Python3, absolute imports are now the default.

   This was already present for Python3.3, and it turns out that all of
   Python3 does it.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Constants are now much less often created with ``pickle`` module, but
   created directly.

   This esp. applies for nested constants, now more values become ``is``
   identical instead of only ``==`` identical, which indicates a reduced
   memory usage.

   .. code:: python

      a = ("something_special",)
      b = "something_special"

      assert a[0] is b  # Now true

   This is not only about memory efficiency, but also about performance.
   Less memory usage is more cache friendly, and the "==" operator will
   be able to shortcut dramatically in cases of identical objects.

   Constants now created without ``pickle`` usage, cover ``float``,
   ``list``, and ``dict``, which is enough for PyStone to not use it at
   all, which has been added support for as well.

-  Continue statements might be optimized away.

   A terminal ``continue`` in a loop, was not optimized away:

   .. code:: python

      while 1:
          something
          continue  # Now optimized away

   The trailing ``continue`` has no effect and can therefore be removed.

   .. code:: python

      while 1:
          something

-  Loops with only break statements are optimized away.

   .. code:: python

      while 1:
          break

   A loop immediately broken has of course no effect. Loop conditions
   are re-formulated to immediate "if ... : break" checks. Effectively
   this means that loops with conditions detected to be always false to
   see the loop entirely removed.

***********
 New Tests
***********

-  Added tests for the found issues.

-  Running the programs test suite (i.e. recursion) for Python3.2 and
   Python3.2 as well, after making adaptation so that the absolute
   import changes are now covered.

-  Running the "CPython3.2" test suite with Python3.3 based Nuitka works
   and found a few minor issues.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  The `Downloads <https://nuitka.net/doc/download.html>`__ page now
   offers RPMs for RHEL6, CentOS6, F17, F18, and openSUSE 12.1, 12.2,
   12.3. This large coverage is thanks to openSUSE build service and
   "ownssh" for contributing an RPM spec file.

   The page got improved with logos for the distributions.

-  Added "ownssh" as contributor.

-  Revamped the `User Manual
   <https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`__ in terms of layout,
   structure, and content.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release is the result of much validation work. The amount of fixes
the largest of any release so far. New platforms, basic Python3.3
support, consolidation all around.
