############################
 Ubuntu Packages for Nuitka
############################

Hello there,

as I previously said, I will make these a separate announcement. Thanks
to the NeuroDebian project build infrastructure, there is Nuitka
packages for the Ubuntu versions back to Maverick, Natty, and Oneiric.

Please see the page `What is Nuitka? </pages/overview.html>`_ for
clarification of what it is now and what it wants to be.

You may use the apt sources to track Nuitka or download the packages
from the page where I offer the `latest version here
</pages/download.html>`_.

Note: In fact, it's 0.3.19.1 now, which includes a hotfix release made
after 0.3.19. The same is in Debian Unstable right now, waiting to
propagate into Debian Testing, where there is still 0.3.18 living at
this time.

I would appreciate feedback on these.

Thanks in advance, Kay
