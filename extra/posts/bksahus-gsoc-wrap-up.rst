 bksahu's GSoC warp up
#######################

Hello everyone!

GSoC 2019 has almost come to an end! It's the time to wrap up this mega
event started back in May 2019. Under the mentorship of Mentor Hayen, my
learning experience has undergone a roller-coaster ride and it has not
only boosted my growth as a developer but also as an individual. Over
the last 3 months the following are my major contributions to this
project:

*************************
 Built-ins Optimizations
*************************

-  "any": `PR #246 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/246>`__
      -  `nuitka.nodes.BuiltinAnyNodes` node added to optimize the "any"
         built-in.

      -  Developed an algorithm to predict the "any" for arguments
         having repetitive values at compile time. For example:

            any([0]*255) -> False

            any([False, False, True]) -> True

      -  Extended support for `range`, `set` and `dict` built-ins.

      -  Added the optimized C side support too

      -  Added a method `getMetaClassBase` to make Python 2 and Python 3
         compatible while working with metaclasses.

-  Issue reported and closed `Issue #349 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/349>`__
      -  Created a new module `nuitka.nodes.IterationHandles` to work
         with iterables.
      -  Added support of Iteration for non-mutable types.

-  "all": `PR #407 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/407>`__
      -  Added `nuitka.nodes.BuiltinAllNodes` to optimize the "all"
         built-ins.

      -  Developed an algorithm similar to "any" to predict the "all"
         arguments. For example:

            all([0, 0, 1]) -> False

            all([True]*100) -> True

      -  Other similar optimizations are done like "any" built-in.

      -  Additionally, added a new testing module
         `tests.optimizations.CommonOptimizations` to test the built-ins
         optimizations at the same place.

-  "abs": `PR #419 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/419>`__
      -  Added new operation node `ExpressionOperationAbs` to optimize
         the `abs` built-in.
      -  Manually added `shapeSlotAbs` to different shapes.
      -  Finally pre-computed the compile time constant `abs`

-  "max" and "min": `PR #442 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/442>`__
      -  This PR is work in progress and is half complete.

      -  This is the first optimizations in which I used reformulations
         instead of added in a new node.

      -  Pseudo-code of "min" reformulation:

         .. code:: python

            def _min(a, b, c, ...):
             tmp_arg1 = a
             tmp_arg2 = b
             tmp_arg3 = c
             ...
             result = tmp_arg1
             if keyfunc is None: # can be decided during re-formulation
                 tmp_key_result = keyfunc(result)
                 tmp_key_candidate = keyfunc(tmp_arg2)
                 if tmp_key_candidate < tmp_key_result:
                     result = tmp_arg2
                     tmp_key_result = tmp_key_candidate
                 tmp_key_candidate = keyfunc(tmp_arg3)
                 if tmp_key_candidate < tmp_key_result:
                     result = tmp_arg3
                     tmp_key_result = tmp_key_candidate
                 ...
             else:
                 if tmp_arg2 < result:
                     result = tmp_arg2
                 if tmp_arg3 < result:
                     result = tmp_arg3
                 ...
              return result

      -  Adding support for `keyfunc` is pending

-  "zip": `PR #462 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/462>`__
      -  This built-in uses both types of optimizations that the
         previous built-ins optimizations used.
      -  `zip` for Python 2 uses the reformulations.
      -  Pseudo-code of "zip" reformulation:

      .. code:: python

         def _zip(a, b, c, ... ):
         # First assign, to preserve order of execution,
         # the arguments might be complex expressions.
         tmp_arg1 = a
         tmp_arg2 = b
         tmp_arg3 = c
         ...
         tmp_iter_1 = iter(tmp_arg1)
         tmp_iter_2 = iter(tmp_arg2)
         tmp_iter_3 = iter(tmp_arg3)
         ...
         # could be more
         tmp_result = []
         try:
             while 1:
                 tmp_result.append(
                     (
                          next(tmp_iter_1),
                          next(tmp_iter_2),
                          next(tmp_iter_3),
                          ...
                     )
                  )
            except StopIteration:
                pass
          return tmp_result

      -  `zip` for Python 3 needs a new node that calls the `zip`
         because unlike `zip` in Python 2, `zip` in Python 3 returns a
         `zipobject`.

************
 Test suite
************

-  Search mode "All": `PR #378 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/378>`__
      -  In the test suite, I added a new search mode "all" that will
         test all the modules and return all the results at once. For
         example:

      .. code:: bash

         $ ./tests/basics/run_all.py all
            Using concrete python 2.7.12 on x86_64
            Comparing output of 'Asserts.py' using '/usr/bin/python' with flags silent, expect_success, remove_output,     recurse_all, original_file, cpython_cache, plugin_enable:pylint-warnings ...
            .
            .
            .
            .
            Total 0 error(s) found.

-  Search mode "Only": `PR #333 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/333>`__
      -  Added "only" search mode to test only a single module. For
         example:

      .. code:: bash

         $ ./tests/basics/run_all.py only BuiltinsTest.py
            Using concrete python 2.7.12 on x86_64
            Skipping Asserts.py
            Skipping Assignments.py
            Skipping BigConstants.py
            Skipping Branching.py
            Skipping BuiltinOverload.py
            Skipping BuiltinSuper.py
            Comparing output of 'BuiltinsTest.py' using '/usr/bin/python' with flags silent, expect_success, remove_output, recurse_all, original_file, cpython_cache, plugin_enable:pylint-warnings ...

-  Reported and closed Issue #334: `PR #336 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/336>`__
      -  Fixed the autoformat bug by reading and writing the files in
         bytes instead of string.

***************
 Documentation
***************

-  Nuitka git work flow: `PR #485
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/485>`__

And other minor doc fixes are added with their respective pull requests.

****************
 What I learned
****************

-  Learned the software engineering principles and how to keep my work
   clean.

-  I also learned how to effectively use software designing principles
   like `DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__
   and `KISS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`__.

-  Got exposed to Nuitka internals which helped me to better understand
   how compilers in general work.

-  Explored how CPython works internally.

-  Got some great advice from Mentor Hayen about starting my
   professional career in Software engineering.

Overall, it was a great experience to be a part of Nuitka :)
