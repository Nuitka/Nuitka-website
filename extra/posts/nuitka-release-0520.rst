#######################
 Nuitka Release 0.5.20
#######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release is mostly about catching up with issues. Most address
standalone problems with special modules, but there are also some
general compatibility corrections, as well as important fixes for
Python3.5 and coroutines and to improve compatibility with special
Python variants like Anaconda under the Windows system.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Standalone Python3.5: The ``_decimal`` module at least is using a
   ``__name__`` that doesn't match the name at load time, causing
   programs that use it to crash.

-  Compatibility: For Python3.3 the ``__loader__`` attribute is now set
   in all cases, and it needs to have a ``__module__`` attribute. This
   makes inspection as done by e.g. ``flask`` working.

-  Standalone: Added missing hidden dependencies for ``Tkinter`` module,
   adding support for this to work properly.

-  Windows: Detecting the Python DLL and EXE used at compile time and
   preserving this information use during backend compilation. This
   should make sure we use the proper ones, and avoids hacks for
   specific Python variants, enhancing the support for Anaconda,
   WinPython, and CPython installations.

-  Windows: The ``--python-debug`` flag now properly detects if the run
   time is supporting things and error exits if it's not available. For
   a CPython3.5 installation, it will switch between debug and non-debug
   Python binaries and DLLs.

-  Standalone: Added plug-in for the ``Pwm`` package to properly combine
   it into a single file, suitable for distribution.

-  Standalone: Packages from standard library, e.g. ``xml`` now have
   proper ``__path__`` as a list and not as a string value, which breaks
   code of e.g. PyXML.

-  Standalone: Added missing dependency of ``twisted.protocols.tls``.

-  Python3.5: When finalizing coroutines that were not finished, a
   corruption of its reference count could happen under some
   circumstances.

-  Standalone: Added missing DLL dependency of the ``uuid`` module at
   run time, which uses ctypes to load it.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Added support for Anaconda Python on this Linux. Both accelerated and
   standalone mode work now.

-  Added support for standalone mode on FreeBSD.

-  The plug-in framework was expanded with new features to allow
   addressing some specific issues.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Moved memory related stuff to dedicated utils package
   ``nuitka.utils.MemoryUsage`` as part of an effort to have more
   topical modules.

-  Plugins how have a dedicated module through which the core accesses
   the API, which was partially cleaned up.

-  No more "early" and "late" import detections for standalone mode. We
   now scan everything at the start.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release focused on expanding plugins. These were then used to
enhance the success of standalone compatibility. Eventually this should
lead to a finished and documented plug-in API, which will open up the
Nuitka core to easier hacks and more user contribution for these topics.
