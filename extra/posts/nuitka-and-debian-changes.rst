 Nuitka and Debian changes
###########################

Hello everybody,

this is just a quick note to Nuitka users that are Debian users. For
Debian, the freeze has arrived. This is a time of great joy for me. I
love Debian so deeply, I believe I am now for at least 10 years on it,
of 15 years on Linux.

As you may know, Nuitka has been in Debian for some time now. In
discussion with my great sponsor Yaroslav Halchenko, we needed to
consider if Nuitka is ready to be maintained in Debian Stable.

And for that I have to admit, it is just not ready. You will be able to
download packages from the `Downloads </pages/download.html>`_ and
install them. They will still be in Debian Unstable, but they won't be
in Debian Testing and the next Debian Stable.
