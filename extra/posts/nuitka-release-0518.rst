 Nuitka Release 0.5.18
#######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release mainly has a scalability focus. While there are few
compatibility improvements, the larger goal has been to make Nuitka
compilation and the final C compilation faster.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Compatibility: The nested arguments functions can now be called using
   their keyword arguments.

   .. code:: python

      def someFunction(a, (b, c)):
          return a, b, c


      someFunction(a=1, **{".1": (2, 3)})

-  Compatibility: Generators with Python3.4 or higher now also have a
   ``__del__`` attribute, and therefore properly participate in
   finalization. This should improve their interactions with garbage
   collection reference cycles, although no issues had been observed so
   far.

-  Windows: Was outputting command line arguments debug information at
   program start. Fixed in 0.5.17.1 already.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Code generated for parameter parsing is now a *lot* less verbose.
   Python level loops and conditionals to generate code for each
   variable has been replaced with C level generic code. This will speed
   up the backend compilation by a lot.

-  Function calls with constant arguments were speed up specifically, as
   their call is now fully prepared, and yet using less code. Variable
   arguments are also faster, and all defaulted arguments are also much
   faster. Method calls are not affected by these improvements though.

-  Nested argument functions now have a quick call entry point as well,
   making them faster to call too.

-  The ``slice`` built-in, and internal creation of slices (e.g. in
   re-formulations of Python3 slices as subscripts) cannot raise.

-  Standalone: Avoid inclusion of bytecode of ``unittest.test``,
   ``sqlite3.test``, ``distutils.test``, and ``ensurepip``. These are
   not needed, but simply bloat the amount of bytecode used on e.g.
   macOS.

-  Speed up compilation with Nuitka itself by avoid to copying and
   constructing variable lists as much as possible using an always
   accurate variable registry.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Nested argument functions of Python2 are now re-formulated into a
   wrapping function that directly calls the actual function body with
   the unpacking of nested arguments done in nodes explicitly. This
   allows for better optimization and checks of these steps and
   potential in-lining of these functions too.

-  Unified slice object creation and built-in ``slice`` nodes, these
   were two distinct nodes before.

-  The code generation for all statement kinds is now done via
   dispatching from a dictionary instead of long ``elif`` chains.

-  Named nodes more often consistently, e.g. all loop related nodes
   start with ``Loop`` now, making them easier to group.

-  Parameter specifications got simplified to work without variables
   where it is possible.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  Nuitka is now available on the social code platforms gitlab as well.

*********
 Summary
*********

Long standing weaknesses have been addressed in this release, also quite
a few structural cleanups have been performed, e.g. strengthening the
role of the variable registry to always be accurate, is groundlaying to
further improvement of optimization.

However, this release cycle was mostly dedicated to performance of the
actual compilation, and more accurate information was needed to e.g. not
search for information that should be instant.

Upcoming releases will focus on usability issues and further
optimization, it was nice however to see speedups of created code even
from these scalability improvements.
