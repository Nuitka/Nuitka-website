 Nuitka and GUIs
#################

Please see the page `"What is Nuitka?" </pages/overview.html>`_ for
clarification of what it is now and what it wants to be.

Nuitka is a typical compiler, just for Python, and aims to be
integrating with build tools, and as such is so much a command line
tool, it hurts.

Yet, there are GUIs. Yes, *plural*, there are even two.

Many of you are maybe using Ninja IDE already. I have developed most of
early Nuitka in vim, and later, mostly because of Nuitka, switched back
to Emacs. I had switched from Emacs at one point 12 years ago, but then
went back a couple of years ago.

But recently `+Juan Carlos
<https://plus.google.com/118074123761587415902/about>`_ convinced me to
give Ninja a try. Because not only is he the creator the `Nuitka GUI
<https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nuitka-gui>`_, but also the creator
of the `Ninja IDE plugin
<https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nuitka-ninja>`_ for Nuitka.

So on Windows, I now use Ninja, and I like it, a lot.

I must admit, I am not a heavy user of both Nuitka GUIs, rather being a
command line guy I suppose, but that is just great. I would like to
thank Juan Carlos for these contributions.

They are one sign of Nuitka getting more external recognition. It is
showing that the eco system around Nuitka is indeed warming up.
