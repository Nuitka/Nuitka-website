 Nuitka Debian Package and Windows Installer
#############################################

There is now a Windows installer and a Debian package of `Nuitka
</pages/overview.html>`_ available on the `Download
</pages/download.html>`_ page. Please try it out and give me feedback.

Specifically I do know that the Debian package won't work on Debian
Squeeze, but only on Debian Wheezy (Testing) maybe it does on Ubuntu as
well, please report. If you have anything to criticize about the
package, let me know. There is no apt source now, I hope to get it into
Debian proper directly.

UPDATE: After Stani's report that Ubuntu has an older Scons, I lowered
the dependency and updated the package on the page. It may now work on
Ubuntu as well.

And then, the Windows installer still requires you to install MinGW and
add it to your path, but it's clearly a huge step ahead. It's created
with distutils, and that works very well. If you have the skills to
enhance it, so e.g. the PATH variable is changed, or it will launch a
MinGW install if not present, contact me and help.

UPDATE: And the idea that I got while writing a reply to "swong" is also
now implemented. The new Nuitka on Windows simply guesses the PATH to
MinGW to be the default path ``C:\MinGW`` or at least ``\MinGW`` and
from there, it ought to just run after you installed it. Of course you
can still set your own PATH environment and make the pick yourself.
