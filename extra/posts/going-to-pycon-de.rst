 Going to PyCon DE
###################

Hello everybody,

I am going to the German Python conference in Leipzip and I am going to
have a `presentation
<http://2011.de.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/54/>`_ (link in German)
there.

Of course it's about Nuitka (see `What is Nuitka?
</pages/overview.html>`_ ) and I hope it will get a lot of attendance. I
am naturally very happy to have the opportunity to present it finally. I
had wanted to visit PyCon EU, but the date was never known, and then my
early booking holiday overlapped with it, so it was not an option.

Now giving this presentation will of course be exciting to me. I gave
presentations as part of the day job many times, but this time it's
obviously a different. It's also a first chance to meet the others as I
never was at a Python conference before, and that will be interesting in
itself.

Presenting Nuitka will of course be easy for me. Now I need to plan what
I want to be able to present for a demo. Running a big thing like
Mercurial would be nice, but I honestly don't know, if that will even be
difficult, or if it will take a lot of work. Also the amount of
documentation available for Nuitka should increase as part of this.
Designs, etc. could be made into diagrams, so people who want to join
will have it easier.

Lots of possibilities, and then there is only going to be one reality.
Lets hope it's good. :-)

|  Yours,
|  Kay
