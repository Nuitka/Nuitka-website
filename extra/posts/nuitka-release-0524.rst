#######################
 Nuitka Release 0.5.24
#######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release is again focusing on optimization, this time very heavily
on the generator performance, which was found to be much slower than
CPython for some cases. Also there is the usual compatibility work and
improvements for Pure C support.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Windows: The 3.5.2 coroutine new protocol implementation was using
   the wrapper from CPython, but it's not part of the ABI on Windows.
   Have our own instead. Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

-  Windows: Fixed second compilation with MSVC failing. The files
   renamed to be C++ files already existed, crashing the compilation.
   Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

-  Mac OS: Fixed creating extension modules with ``.so`` suffix. This is
   now properly determined by looking at the importer details, leading
   to correct suffix on all platforms. Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

-  Debian: Don't depend on a C++ compiler primarily anymore, the C
   compiler from GNU or clang will do too. Fixed in 0.5.23.1 already.

-  Pure C: Adapted scons compiler detecting to properly consider C11
   compilers from the environment, and more gracefully report things.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Python2: Generators were saving and restoring exceptions, updating
   the variables ``sys.exc_type`` for every context switch, making it
   really slow, as these are 3 dictionary updates, normally not needed.
   Now it's only doing it if it means a change.

-  Sped up creating generators, coroutines and coroutines by attaching
   the closure variable storage directly to the object, using one
   variable size allocation, instead of two, once of which was a
   standard ``malloc``. This makes creating them easier and avoids
   maintaining the closure pointer entirely.

-  Using dedicated compiled cell implementation similar to
   ``PyCellObject`` but fully under our control. This allowed for
   smaller code generated, while still giving a slight performance
   improvement.

-  Added free list implementation to cache generator, coroutines, and
   function objects, avoiding the need to create and delete this kind of
   objects in a loop.

-  Added support for the built-in ``sum``, making slight optimizations
   to be much faster when iterating over lists and tuples, as well as
   fast ``long`` sum for Python2, and much faster ``bool`` sums too.
   This is using a prototype version of a "qiter" concept.

-  Provide type shape for ``xrange`` calls that are not constant too,
   allowing for better optimization related to those.

*******
 Tests
*******

-  Added workarounds for locks being held by Virus Scanners on Windows
   to our test runner.

-  Enhanced constructs that test generator expressions to more clearly
   show the actual construct cost.

-  Added construct tests for the ``sum`` built-in on various types of
   ``int`` containers, making sure we can do all of those really fast.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release improves very heavily on generators in Nuitka. The memory
allocator is used more cleverly, and free lists all around save a lot of
interactions with it. More work lies ahead in this field, as these are
not yet as fast as they should be. However, at least Nuitka should be
faster than CPython for these kind of usages now.

Also, proper pure C in the Scons is relatively important to cover more
of the rarer use cases, where the C compiler is too old.

The most important part is actually how ``sum`` optimization is staging
a new kind of approach for code generation. This could become the
standard code for iterators in loops eventually, making ``for`` loops
even faster. This will be for future releases to expand.
