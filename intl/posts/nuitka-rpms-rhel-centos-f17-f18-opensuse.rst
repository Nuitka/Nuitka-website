################################################
 Nuitka RPMs (RHEL, CentOS, F17, F18, openSUSE)
################################################

Thanks to a contribution, Nuitka now has a proper RPM spec file. And
using `openSUSE Build Service
<https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:kayhayen/Nuitka>`__, we
can now enjoy RPMs for all major distributions.

Check out the revamped `download page </pages/download.html>`_ as well.

.. note::

   At the time of this writing, the "stable" Nuitka 0.4.1 link points to
   a 0.4.2 pre-release. That is only until 0.4.2 final will be released.

Thanks for making this possible, very much appreciated.
