######################
 Nuitka Release 0.6.2
######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release has a huge focus on organisational things. Nuitka is
growing in terms of contributors and supported platforms.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Fix, the Python flag ``--python-flag=-O`` was removing doc strings,
   but that should only be done with ``--python-flag=-OO`` which was
   added too.

-  Fix, accelerated binaries failed to load packages from the
   ``virtualenv`` (not ``venv``) that they were created and ran with,
   due to not propagating ``sys.prefix``.

-  Standalone: Do not include ``plat-*`` directories as frozen code, and
   also on some platforms they can also contain code that fails to
   import without error.

-  Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency needed for newer NumPy
   versions.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Added support for Alpine Linux.

-  Added support for MSYS2 based Python on Windows.

-  Added support for Python flag ``--python flag=-OO``, which allows to
   remove doc strings.

-  Added experimental support for ``pefile`` based dependency scans on
   Windows, thanks to Orsiris for this contribution.

-  Added plugin for proper Tkinter standalone support on Windows, thanks
   to Jorj for this contribution.

-  There is now a ``__compiled__`` attribute for each module that Nuitka
   has compiled. Should be like this now, and contains Nuitka version
   information for you to use, similar to what ``sys.version_info``
   gives as a ``namedtuple`` for your checks.

   .. code:: python

      __nuitka_version__(major=0, minor=6, micro=2, releaselevel="release")

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Experimental code for variant types for ``int`` and ``long`` values,
   that can be plain C value, as well as the ``PyObject *``. This is not
   yet completed though.

-  Minor refinements of specialized code variants reducing them more
   often the actual needed code.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  The Nuitka Github Organisation that was created a while ago and owns
   the Nuitka repo now, has gained members. Check out
   https://github.com/orgs/Nuitka/people for their list. This is an
   exciting transformation for Nuitka.

-  Nuitka is participating in the GSoC 2019 under the PSF umbrella. We
   hope to grow even further. Thanks to the mentors who volunteered for
   this important task. Check out the `GSoC 2019 page
   <https://nuitka.net/pages/gsoc2019.html#mentors>`__ and thanks to the
   students that are already helping out.

-  Added Nuitka internal `API documentation
   <https://nuitka.net/apidoc>`__ that will receive more love in the
   future. It got some for this release, but a lot is missing.

-  The Nuitka code has been ``black``-ened and is formatted with an
   automatic tool now all the way, which makes contributors lives
   easier.

-  Added documentation for questions received as part of the GSoC
   applications and ideas work.

-  Some proof reading pull requests were merged for the documentation,
   thanks to everybody who addresses these kinds of errors. Sometimes
   typos, sometimes broken links, etc.

-  Updated inline copy of Scons used for Python3 to 3.0.4, which
   hopefully means more bugs are fixed.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release is a sign of increasing adoption of Nuitka. The GSoC 2019
is showing early effects, as is more developers joining the effort.
These are great times for Nuitka.

This release has not much on the optimization side that is user visible,
but the work that has begun is capable of producing glorious benchmarks
once it will be finished.

The focus on this and coming releases is definitely to open up the
Nuitka development now that people are coming in as permanent or
temporary contributors in (relatively) high numbers.
