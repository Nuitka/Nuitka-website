######################
 Nuitka Release 0.6.0
######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release adds massive improvements for optimization and a couple of
bug fixes.

It also indicates reaching the mile stone of doing actual type
inference, even if only very limited.

And with the new version numbers, lots of UI changes go along. The
options to control recursion into modules have all been renamed, some
now have different defaults, and finally the filenames output have
changed.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  Python3.5: Fix, the awaiting flag was not removed for exceptions
   thrown into a coroutine, so next time it appeared to be awaiting
   instead of finished.

-  Python3: Classes in generators that were using built-in functions
   crashed the compilation with C errors.

-  Some regressions for XML outputs from previous changes were fixed.

-  Fix, ``hasattr`` was not raising an exception if used with non-string
   attributes.

-  For really large compilations, MSVC linker could choke on the input
   file, line length limits, which is now fixed for the inline copy of
   Scons.

-  Standalone: Follow changed hidden dependency of ``PyQt5`` to
   ``PyQt5.sip`` for newer versions

-  Standalone: Include certificate file using by ``requests`` module in
   some cases as a data file.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Enabled C target type ``nuitka_bool`` for variables that are stored
   with boolean shape only, and generate C code for those

-  Using C target type ``nuitka_bool`` many more expressions are now
   handled better in conditions.

-  Enhanced ``is`` and ``is not`` to be C source type aware, so they can
   be much faster for them.

-  Use C target type for ``bool`` built-in giving more efficient code
   for some source values.

-  Annotate the ``not`` result to have boolean type shape, allowing for
   more compile time optimization with it.

-  Restored previously lost optimization of loop break handling
   ``StopIteration`` which makes loops much faster again.

-  Restore lost optimization of subscripts with constant integer values
   making them faster again.

-  Optimize in-place operations for cases where left, right, or both
   sides have known type shapes for some values. Initially only a few
   variants were added, but there is more to come.

-  When adjacent parts of an f-string become known string constants,
   join them at compile time.

-  When there is only one remaining part in an f-string, use that
   directly as the result.

-  Optimize empty f-strings directly into empty strings constant during
   the tree building phase.

-  Added specialized attribute check for use in re-formulations that
   doesn't expose exceptions.

-  Remove locals sync operation in scopes without local variables, e.g.
   classes or modules, making ``exec`` and the like slightly leaner
   there.

-  Remove ``try`` nodes that did only re-raise exceptions.

-  The ``del`` of variables is now driven fully by C types and generates
   more compatible code.

-  Removed useless double exception exits annotated for expressions of
   conditions and added code that allows conditions to adapt themselves
   to the target shape bool during optimization.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Added support for using ``.egg`` files in ``PYTHONPATH``, one of the
   more rare uses, where Nuitka wasn't yet compatible.

-  Output binaries in standalone mode with platform suffix, on
   non-Windows that means no suffix. In accelerated mode on non-Windows,
   use ``.bin`` as a suffix to avoid collision with files that have no
   suffix.

-  Windows: It's now possible to use ``clang-cl.exe`` for ``CC`` with
   Nuitka as a third compiler on Windows, but it requires an existing
   MSVC install to be used for resource compilation and linking.

-  Windows: Added support for using ``ccache.exe`` and ``clcache.exe``,
   so that object files can now be cached for re-compilation.

-  For debug mode, report missing in-place helpers. These kinds of
   reports are to become more universal and are aimed at recognizing
   missed optimization chances in Nuitka. This features is still in its
   infancy. Subsequent releases will add more like these.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  Disabled comments on the web site, we are going to use Twitter
   instead, once the site is migrated to an updated Nikola.

-  The static C code is now formatted with ``clang-format`` to make it
   easier for contributors to understand.

-  Moved the construct runner to top level binary and use it from there,
   with future changes coming that should make it generally useful
   outside of Nuitka.

-  Enhanced the issue template to tell people how to get the ``develop``
   version of Nuitka to try it out.

-  Added documentation for how use the object caching on Windows to the
   User Manual.

-  Removed the included GUI, originally intended for debugging, but XML
   outputs are more powerful anyway, and it had been in disrepair for a
   long time.

-  Removed long deprecated options, e.g. ``--exe`` which has long been
   the default and is no more accepted.

-  Renamed options to include plugin files to
   ``--include-plugin-directory`` and ``--include-plugin-files`` for
   more clarity.

-  Renamed options for recursion control to e.g. ``--follow-imports`` to
   better express what they actually do.

-  Removed ``--python-version`` support for switching the version during
   compilation. This has only worked for very specific circumstances and
   has been deprecated for a while.

-  Removed ``--code-gen-no-statement-lines`` support for not having line
   numbers updated at run time. This has long been hidden and probably
   would never gain all that much, while causing a lot of
   incompatibilty.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Moved command line arguments to dedicated module, adding checks was
   becoming too difficult.

-  Moved rich comparison helpers to a dedicated C file.

-  Dedicated binary and unary node bases for clearer distinction and
   more efficient memory usage of unuary nodes. Unary operations also no
   longer have in-place operation as an issue.

-  Major cleanup of variable accesses, split up into multiple phases and
   all including module variables being performed through C types, with
   no special cases anymore.

-  Partial cleanups of C type classes with code duplications, there is
   much more to resolve though.

-  Windows: The way ``exec`` was performed is discouraged in the
   ``subprocess`` documentation, so use a variant that cannot block
   instead.

-  Code proving information about built-in names and values was using
   not very portable constructs, and is now written in a way that PyPy
   would also like.

*******
 Tests
*******

-  Avoid using ``2to3`` for basic operators test, removing test of some
   Python2 only stuff, that is covered elsewhere.

-  Added ability to cache output of CPython when comparing to it. This
   is to allow CI tests to not execute the same code over and over, just
   to get the same value to compare with. This is not enabled yet.

*********
 Summary
*********

This release marks a point, from which on performance improvements are
likely in every coming release. The C target types are a major
milestone. More C target types are in the work, e.g. ``void`` is coming
for expressions that are done, but not used, that is scheduled for the
next release.

Although there will be a need to also adapt optimization to take full
advantage of it, progress should be quick from here. There is a lot of
ground to cover, with more C types to come, and all of them needing
specialized helpers. But as soon as e.g. ``int``, ``str`` are covered,
many more programs are going to benefiting from this.
