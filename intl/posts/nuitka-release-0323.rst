 Nuitka Release 0.3.23
#######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release is the one that completes the Nuitka "sun rise phase".

All of Nuitka is now released under `Apache License 2.0
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`__ which is a very liberal
license, and compatible with basically all Free Software licenses there
are. It's only asking to allow integration, of what you send back, and
patent grants for the code.

In the first phase of Nuitka development, I wanted to keep control over
Nuitka, so it wouldn't repeat mistakes of other projects. This is no
longer a concern for me, it's not going to happen anymore.

I would like to thank Debian Legal team, for originally bringing to my
attention, that this license will be better suited, than any copyright
assignment could be.

***********
 Bug fixes
***********

-  The compiled functions could not be used with ``multiprocessing`` or
   ``copy.copy``. Fixed in 0.3.22.1 already.

-  In-place operations for slices with not both bounds specified crashed
   the compiler. Fixed in 0.3.22.1 already.

-  Cyclic imports could trigger an endless loop, because module import
   expressions became the parent of the imported module object. Fixed in
   0.3.22.2 already.

-  Modules named ``proc`` or ``func`` could not be compiled to modules
   or embedded due to a collision with identifiers of CPython2.7
   includes. Fixed in 0.3.22.2 already.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  The function copying fix also makes pickling of compiled functions
   available. As it is the case for non-compiled functions in CPython,
   no code objects are stored, only names of module level variables.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  Using the Apache License 2.0 for all of Nuitka now.

-  Speedcenter has been re-activated, but is not yet having a lot of
   benchmarks yet, subject to change.

   .. admonition:: Update

      We have given up on this version of speedcenter meanwhile, and
      generate static pages with graphs instead. We can this still
      speedcenter.

***********
 New Tests
***********

-  Changed the "CPython26" tests to no longer disable the parts that
   relied on copying of functions to work as that is now supported.

-  Extended in-place assignment tests to cover error cases of we had
   issues with.

-  Extended compile library test to also try and compile the path where
   ``numpy`` lives. This is apparently another path, where Debian
   installs some modules, and compiling this would have revealed issues
   sooner.

*********
 Summary
*********

The release contains bug fixes, and the huge step of changing `the
license <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`__. It is made in
preparation to `PyCON EU <https://ep2012.europython.eu>`__.
