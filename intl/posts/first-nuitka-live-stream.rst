##########################
 First Nuitka Live Stream
##########################

Tomorrow, Saturday 15.01.2022, there will be not one, but two live
stream of me coding on Nuitka, and talking and chatting with visitors in
the Discord channel created specifically for this. I will go from 9-12
CEST and from 17-20 CEST.

There is a `dedicated page on the web site </pages/Streaming.html>`_
which has the details. Spoiler, it's free and I have no plans for
anything that involves a subscription of any kind. Of course, talking of
subscription, do also checkout the `Nuitka commercial
</doc/commercial.html>`_ offering. That is a subscription with adds that
protect your IP even more than regular Nuitka.

I want to do this on a regular basis, and I will be happy to do this
even when nearly nobody shows up. It will be however your chance, and in
previous GSoC and generally, I made very good experiences with joint
sessions. So I hope you will help me pasting code snippets and Google
results in chat, and discuss the optimization that we are going to add.

Come and join me there. `Instructions </pages/Streaming.html>`_ here.
You know you want to do it. I know I want you to do to it!

|  Yours,
