 Not going to FOSDEM 2014
##########################

So I submitted a talk for FOSDEM "Python has a compiler now". And it
didn't get accepted. Quite a surprise to me, but likely mostly logical.
These are the accepted talks (link since became unavailable) and well,
it surely didn't fit in, right.

My intent was to introduce `Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`__ to the
larger community. Not going to happen now, but maybe next year.

Clearly triggered by the rejection, I am questioning Europython 2014 in
Berlin as a useful destination too. To me it seems, that code writing is
the best way to create the community at this time anyway.
