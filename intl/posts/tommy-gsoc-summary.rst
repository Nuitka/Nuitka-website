As Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is coming to an end, I am writing this
blog post as a final summary describing all the work I have done as well
as my experiences in this program.

####################
 Summary of My Work
####################

-  `#314 run_all.py new special-comment mechanism & Urllib3Using.py
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/314>`__

   -  Before GSoC started, I looked around for whatever work I could
      help with.

   -  In this pull request, I added a ``checkRequirements`` function for
      the Nuitka standalone test suite.

   -  This function checks for special-comments at the top of standalone
      tests in the format of ``# nuitka-skip-unless-expression:
      expression to be evaluated`` OR ``# nuitka-skip-unless-imports:
      module1,module2,...`` and will decide whether to skip a test
      depending on if its specified requirements are met.

   -  In addition, standalone test ``Urllib3Using.py`` was created.

   -  This pull request was soon merged and allowed me the lucky
      opportunity of GSoC 2019 with Nuitka :)

-  `#339 Standalone tests for botocore & boto3 + fix to Urllib3Using.py
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/339>`__

   -  This PR was also created before the start of GSoC.

   -  Standalone test ``Boto3Using.py`` was created using ``moto`` to
      mock AWS calls which did not turn out well.

   -  Changed ``Urllib3Using.py`` with the addition of python version
      checks as a fix to `Issue #373
      <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/373>`__.

-  `Urllib3 Wheel with Nuitka Pytest Results
   <https://nuitka.net/posts/urllib3-wheel-with-nuitka.html>`__ and
   `Python-Dateutil Wheel with Nuitka Pytest Results
   <https://nuitka.net/posts/dateutil-wheel-with-nuitka.html>`__

   -  At the start of GSoC, I performed manual pytest comparison for
      PyPI packages ``urllib3`` and ``dateutil``.

   -  The findings of my testing were documented in these postings.

   -  Manual testing compares the pytest results of an installed nuitka
      wheel built using ``python setup.py bdist_nuitka`` to the regular
      pytest results of each package.

   -  Testing is done to ensure that nuitka is building the wheel
      correctly.

   -  If the pytests pass/fail in the same way, that means Nuitka built
      the wheel properly.

   -  Else if the tests differ, then something is wrong.

   -  Virtualenv is used to create a clean environment with no outside
      pollution.

   -  Over the course of performing manual testing, I became familiar
      with the use of ``virtualenv``, ``wheel``, and ``pytest``.

   -  A bug was found with the package ``urllib3`` bdist and I created
      `Issue #413 <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/413>`__ to
      document the bug.

-  `#440 Automating PyPI Wheel Pytest
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/440>`__

   -  After familiarizing myself with how ``virtualenv``, ``wheel``, and
      ``pytest`` work, I started to work on a script which would
      automate the pytest comparison for top PyPI packages.

   -  The script first uses ``git`` to update each package if it is
      already existing in the local cache, else it will ``git clone``
      that package into the local cache.

   -  The script then uses calls to ``os.system`` to automate the
      creation of a ``virtualenv`` which is then used to install
      ``pytest`` and ``pip install`` the package's requirements (if any)
      for running pytest.

   -  The script then handles each package depending on different needs
      before building a regular wheel with ``python setup.py
      bdist_wheel``.

   -  This wheel is then installed into the ``virtualenv``, after which
      ``subprocess.Popen`` is used to run and capture the output of
      ``python -m pytest --disable-warnings`` into a string.

   -  The script then resets the package to its original state and
      builds a nuitka-compiled wheel using ``python setup.py
      bdist_nuitka``.

   -  This compiled wheel is then installed into the ``virtualenv``,
      after which ``subprocess.Popen`` is used to run and capture the
      output of ``python -m pytest --disable-warnings`` into another
      string.

   -  The two strings containing pytest outputs are then compared to
      find differences.

   -  If no differences are found, this means ``bdist_nuitka`` worked
      properly. Else Nuitka compilation did something wrong.

   -  The above process is repeated for each suitable PyPI package from
      the PyPI top 50. (Some packages are left out if they do not
      contain a test suite or if they do not need to be tested)

   -  At the end, a colored summary is given for all the packages
      tested.

   -  This automation script is meant to be run regularly to inform
      developers of Nuitka regressions.

-  `Issue #477 Unable to compile modules listed under
   unworthy_namespaces <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/477>`__

   -  Raised due to package ``pycparser`` failing in the automated test
      suite.
   -  This issue will be addressed in the future.

-  `Issue #479 bdist_nuitka fails for packages containing py_modules
   only <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/479>`__

   -  While I worked on `#440
      <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/440>`__, I found a bug with
      ``bdist_nuitka`` failing on PyPI packages containing py_modules
      only.

   -  This bug occurs due to Nuitka making the assumption that a main
      package always exists for all packages. However, some packages
      contain only a main module and not a main package.

   -  Applies to PyPI packages ``decorator``, ``ipaddress``, and
      ``pyparsing``.

-  `#483 Add support for py_modules_only compilation
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/483>`__

   -  This pull request changes ``bdist_nuitka.py`` and various other
      files to fix `Issue #479
      <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/479>`__.

   -  Checks are added for the ``bdist_nuitka`` command to see if a main
      package exists. If there is not a main package, it will set its
      compile target to the main module instead.

   -  This also addressed the case of a package with both a main package
      and a main module, in which case both are included inside the
      resulting wheel.

   -  In addition, ``distutils`` examples ``py_modules_only`` and
      ``package_and_module`` were created and added for future testing.

   -  During this PR, I found an import bug in Nuitka and hotfixed it
      with `#487 Fixup_import_module
      <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/487>`__.

-  `#484 PyPI Standalone Tests
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/484>`__

   -  This pull request adds more standalone tests for each top PyPI
      package.

-  `#495 Improve pypi automation
   <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/495>`__

   -  Improves the PyPI test suite created in `#440
      <https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/pull/440>`__ with functional
      improvements, readability improvements, and added documentation.

##################
 Things I Learned
##################

Before GSoC, I was very uncomfortable with working inside a terminal. I
was unfamiliar with many basic bash commands because I simply did not
have any prior professional industrial experiences. I was also very
unfamiliar with the Git flow, which is evident in the messy commit
histories of my earliest pull requests.

As I continued throughout my GSoC journey, however, I became much more
comfortable with working inside the terminal as well as using ``git`` as
a version-control system (shoutout to my mentor Kay Hayen for helping me
through all the annoying conflicts).

Although I am still no expert, I can confidently say that I am now far
more proficient working with ``git`` and inside the terminal.

In addition, I became much more familiar with many of the most popular
PyPI packages as well as the inner workings of ``python``, which I
believe will help me go very far in my career as a software developer.

Overall, the GSoC experience was truly astounding and I am more than
thankful to my mentor Kay Hayen as well as Google for making this
amazing program possible.

Yours, `Tommy <https://github.com/tommyli3318>`__
