######################
 Nuitka Release 0.6.4
######################

This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka
<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler,
`"download now" </doc/download.html>`_.

This release contains many bug fixes all across the board. There is also
new optimization and many organisational improvements.

***********
 Bug Fixes
***********

-  When linking very large programs or packages, with gcc compiler,
   Scons can produce commands that are too large for the OS. This
   happens sooner on the Windows OS, but also on Linux. We now have a
   workaround that avoids long command lines by using ``@sources.tmp``
   syntax.

-  Standalone: Remove temporary module after its use, instead of keeping
   it in ``sys.modules`` where e.g. ``Quart`` code tripped over its
   ``__file__`` value that is illegal on Windows.

-  Fixed non-usage of our enhanced detection of ``gcc`` version for
   compilers if given as a full path.

-  Fixed non-detection of ``gnu-cc`` as a form of gcc compiler.

-  Python3.4: The ``__spec__`` value corrections for compiled modules
   was not taking into account that there was a ``__spec__`` value,
   which can happen if something is wrapping imported modules.

-  Standalone: Added implicit dependencies for ``passlib``.

-  Windows: Added workaround for OS command line length limit in
   compilation with MinGW64.

-  Python2: Revive the ``enum`` plugin, there are backports of the buggy
   code it tries to patch up.

-  Windows: Fixup handling of SxS with non zero language id, these occur
   e.g. in Anaconda.

-  Plugins: Handle multiple PyQt plugin paths, e.g. on openSUSE this is
   done, also enhanced finding that path with Anaconda on Windows.

-  Plugins: For ``multiprocessing`` on Windows, allow the ``.exe``
   suffix to not be present, which can happen when ran from command
   line.

-  Windows: Better version checks for DLLs on Python3, the ``ctypes``
   helper code needs more definitions to work properly.

-  Standalone: Added support for both ``pycryptodome`` and
   ``pycryptodomex``.

-  Fix, the ``chr`` built-in was not giving fully compatible error on
   non number input.

-  Fix, the ``id`` built-in doesn't raise an exception, but said
   otherwise.

-  Python3: Proper C identifiers for names that fit into ``latin-1``,
   but are not ``ascii`` encodings.

**************
 New Features
**************

-  Windows: Catch most common user error of using compiler from one
   architecture against Python from another. We now check those and
   compare it, and if they do not match, inform the user directly.
   Previously the compilation could fail, or the linking, with cryptic
   errors.

-  Distutils: Using setuptools and its runners works now too, not merely
   only pure distutils.

-  Distutils: Added more ways to pass Nuitka specific options via
   distutils.

-  Python3.8: Initial compatibility changes to get basic tests to work.

****************
 Organisational
****************

-  Nuitka is participating in the GSoC 2019 with 2 students, Batakrishna
   and Tommy.

-  Point people creating PRs to using the ``pre-commit`` hook in the
   template. Due to making the style issues automatic, we can hope to
   encounter less noise and resulting merge problems.

-  Many improvements to the ``pre-commit`` hook were done, hopefully
   completing its development.

-  Updated to latest ``pylint``, ``black``, and ``isort`` versions, also
   added ``codespell`` to check for typos in the source code, but that
   is not automated yet.

-  Added description of how to use experimental flags for your PRs.

-  Removed mirroring from Bitbucket and Gitlab, as we increasingly use
   the Github organisation features.

-  Added support for Ubuntu Disco, removed support for Ubuntu Artful
   packages.

**************
 Optimization
**************

-  Windows: Attach data blobs as Windows resource files directly for
   programs and avoid using C data files for modules or MinGW64, which
   can be slow.

-  Specialization of helper codes for ``+`` is being done for more types
   and more thoroughly and fully automatic with Jinja2 templating code.
   This does replace previously manual code.

-  Added specialization of helper codes for ``*`` operation which is
   entirely new.

-  Added specialization of helper codes for ``-`` operation which is
   entirely new.

-  Dedicated nodes for specialized operations now allow to save memory
   and all use type shape based analysis to predict result types and
   exception control flow.

-  Better code generation for boolean type values, removing error checks
   when possible.

-  Better static analysis for even more type operations.

**********
 Cleanups
**********

-  Fixed many kinds of typos in the code base with ``codespell``.

-  Apply automatic formatting to more test runner code, these were
   previously not done.

-  Avoid using ``shutil.copytree`` which fails to work when directory
   already exists, instead provide
   ``nuitka.util.FileOperations.copyTree`` and use that exclusively.

*******
 Tests
*******

-  Added new mode of operation to test runners, ``only`` that executes
   just one test and stops, useful during development.

-  Added new mechanism for standalone tests to expression modules that
   need to be importable, or else to skip the test by a special comment
   in the file, instead of by coded checks in the test runner.

-  Added also for more complex cases, another form of special comment,
   that can be any expression, that decides if the test makes sense.

-  Cover also setuptools in our distutils tests and made the execution
   more robust against variable behavior of distutils and setuptools.

-  Added standalone test for Urllib3.

-  Added standalone test for rsa.

-  Added standalone test for Pmw.

-  Added standalone test for passlib.

*********
 Summary
*********

Again this release is a sign of increasing adoption of Nuitka. The GSoC
2019 is also showing effects, definitely will in the next release.

This release has a lot of new optimization, called specialization, but
for it to really used, in many instances, we need to get away from
working on C types for variables only, and get to them beig used for
expressions more often. Otherwise much of the new special code is not
used for most code.

The focus of this release has been again to open up development further
and to incorporate findings from users. The number of fixes or new use
cases working is astounding.

In upcoming releases, new built-ins will be optimized, and
specialization of operations will hit more and more code now that the
infrastructure for it is in place.
