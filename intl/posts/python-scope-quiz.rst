 Quiz Question
###############

Say you have the following module code:

.. code:: python

   a = 1


   class some_class:
       a = a


   def some_function():
       a = a


   some_class()
   some_function()

What is going to happen? Well, think about it, the solution is in the
next paragraph.

The correct answer is that the call "some_function()" is going to give
you a "UnboundLocalError" exception.

This is because it in functions unlike in classes (or modules) do look
ahead for assigned to variable names. Python allocates a slot for local
variables of functions and that is a property that doesn't change -
unless you say "global" of course. This slot is used for every access to
the variable name, which forbids you to make it local.

Surprised? I was too! I only learned it while doing my `Python compiler
Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`_ and I made it a separate posting,
because it really surprised me how different function body and class
body work.
