 Nuitka on Podcast __init__

So, if you want to get to know Nuitka or me, there is a really good
interview from the popular podcast "__init__" online.

`Kay Hayen on Nuitka
<https://www.pythonpodcast.com/episode-28-kay-hayen-on-nuitka/>`__

I think it's very good at explaining things, putting it into
perspective, history, future, and generally getting to know what kind of
person I am.

So, this is probably as good as it ever gets. So please share, like and
go ahead and spread it in this social media craziness that you use all
day.

|  Yours,
