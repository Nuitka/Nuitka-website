 She's a doctor now

My wife has passed the final exams here in Germany finally. I am very
proud of her for managing that. It's with 2 kids born, a new house
built, and lots of difficulties, like not living in a city with a
university that offers medicin as a study course.

To celebrate, here is a picture of her from happy days (no photoshop
unlike the `last time </posts/family-photo.html>`_):
