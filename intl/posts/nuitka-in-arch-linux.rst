 Nuitka in Arch Linux
######################

Got this message:

.. code::

   Just thought you wanted to know that Nuitka is now also an official
   Arch Linux package and can be installed simply with:

   pacman -S nuitka

So, that is another sign of Nuitka getting more external recognition. It
is showing that the eco system around Nuitka is indeed warming up.

Many thanks to Alexander RÃ¸dseth and Panagiotis Mavrogiorgos for
maintaining the Nuitka packages inside Arch and on AUR.
