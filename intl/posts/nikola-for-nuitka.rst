Some time ago, I `asked about static site generators
</posts/static-site-generator.html>`_ and tried a few, but nothing was
as ReST friendly as I would like to. To me, ReST is to text publishing,
what Python is to programming.

Well, the search has found a late hit. I had installed a work flow,
where I was using the XMLRPC interface, but it was some effort, and
somewhat limited.

Then `Roberto Alsina <http://ralsina.com.ar>`_ announced `Nikola
<http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_ that was just what I wanted.

I did migrate to it during the last days. Looking at the content in ReST
form, was a big ease, and I already found a bit of obsolete content, and
updated it. And the last release announcements, they now render somewhat
prettier.

I am not using all the features yet, notable not using the image
galleries yet, and the download page is not yet generated again, and so
on. But this is a good base.

And while I loved it, this was the result:

.. code::

   apt-get remove wordpress
